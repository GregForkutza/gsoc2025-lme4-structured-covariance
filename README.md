Documentation and planning for the GSoC 2025 project: Structured Covariance Matrices for lme4.

Active development for the GSoC 2025 project “Structured Covariance Matrices for lme4” is taking place on the [flexSigma](https://github.com/lme4/lme4/tree/flexSigma) branch.

See [these notes](https://hackmd.io/@HiNq7NkPQlWWRQMavf-SeA/rJPM0ZzZxx) for a breakdown of how structured covariance matrices are implemented in the `flexLambda` branch of `lme4`, including the construction of `theta`, `Lind`, and `Lambdat`.
