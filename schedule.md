### **June – Phase 1: Diagonal and AR(1) Covariance**

#### **June 2 - June 15**
- Implement diagonal covariance support.
- Write unit tests *first*, then implement logic to pass tests.
- Ensure compatibility with `VarCorr()` and `summary()` methods.

#### **June 16 - 29**
- Implement AR(1) covariance structure (e.g., from $\rho$ parameter).
- Add parameter constraints and write simulation-based tests.
- Validate estimates against `glmmTMB`.

**Milestone 1 (End of June)**  
*Diagonal and AR(1) structures fully tested and integrated.*

### **July – Phase 2: Compound Symmetry and Integration**

#### **June 30 - July 13**
- Add compound symmetry (CS) structure.
- Write tests: simulate repeated measures with shared covariance.
- Generalize `mkLmerDevfun()` logic to detect and inject structured $\Lambda_\theta$.

#### **July 18**
- Midterm Evaluations due.
- To be completed: milestone 1 and sufficent progress towards milestone 2. 

#### **July 14 - July 27**
- Ensure all structured forms integrate into penalized least squares pipeline.
- Handle sparse representations for banded (AR(1)) and dense (CS) matrices.
- Add user-facing interface options and improve diagnostic display.

**Milestone 2 (End of July)** 
*All target structures implemented and test suite verified.*

### **August – Phase 3: Docs, Testing, and Diagnostics**

#### **July 28 - August 10**
- Refactor for clarity, modularity, and `lme4`-style conformity.
- Write developer-facing documentation (how to extend $\Lambda_\theta$).
- Add examples to the package vignette.

#### **August 11 - August 24**
- Benchmark against `nlme` and `glmmTMB` for runtime and fit accuracy.
- Add tests for corner cases and validate numerical stability.

**Milestone 3 (Mid August)**  
*Documentation and benchmark testing complete.*

---

### **Late August – Final Wrap-Up**

#### **August 25 - Sep 1**
- Final polish: fix bugs, clean TODOs, update README.
- Submit pull requests with full code, documentation, tests, and examples.
- Write and submit final GSoC report.

 **Final Deliverable**  
*Structured covariance support added to `lme4`, with documentation, diagnostics, and full test suite.*

### **Early September - Final Evaluation**

#### **Sep 1 - Sep 8**
- Mentors and contributor submit final evaluations.
